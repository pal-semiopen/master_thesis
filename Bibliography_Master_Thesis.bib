abstract = {Given any symmetric monoidal category C, a small symmetric monoidal category Σ and a strong monoidal functor j:Σ→C, we construct C[x:jΣ], the polynomial category with a system of (freely adjoined) monoidal indeterminates x:I→j(w), natural in w∈Σ. As a special case, we construct the free co-affine category (symmetric monoidal category with initial unit) on a given small symmetric monoidal category. We then exhibit all the known categories of “possible worlds” used to treat languages that allow for dynamic creation of “new” variables, locations, or names as instances of this construction and explicate their associated universality properties. As an application of the resulting characterization of O(W), Oles’s category of possible worlds, we present an O(W)-indexed Lawvere theory of many-sorted storage, generalizing the single-sorted one introduced by J. Power, and we describe explicitly an associated monad of (typed) block algebras for local storage.}

author = {Sam Staton and Sander Uijlen},
keywords = {Effect algebras, Presheaves, Non-locality, Contextuality},
abstract = {Non-locality and contextuality are among the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory. They are difficult to study using classical logic and probability theory. In this paper we start with an effect algebraic approach to the study of non-locality and contextuality. We will see how different slices over the category of set valued functors on the natural numbers induce different settings in which non-locality and contextuality can be studied. This includes the Bell, Hardy and Kochen–Specker-type paradoxes. We link this to earlier sheaf theoretic approaches by defining a fully faithful embedding of the category of effect algebras in this presheaf category over the natural numbers.}
