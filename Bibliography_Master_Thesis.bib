abstract = {Given any symmetric monoidal category C, a small symmetric monoidal category Σ and a strong monoidal functor j:Σ→C, we construct C[x:jΣ], the polynomial category with a system of (freely adjoined) monoidal indeterminates x:I→j(w), natural in w∈Σ. As a special case, we construct the free co-affine category (symmetric monoidal category with initial unit) on a given small symmetric monoidal category. We then exhibit all the known categories of “possible worlds” used to treat languages that allow for dynamic creation of “new” variables, locations, or names as instances of this construction and explicate their associated universality properties. As an application of the resulting characterization of O(W), Oles’s category of possible worlds, we present an O(W)-indexed Lawvere theory of many-sorted storage, generalizing the single-sorted one introduced by J. Power, and we describe explicitly an associated monad of (typed) block algebras for local storage.}

abstract = {Non-locality and contextuality are among the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory. They are difficult to study using classical logic and probability theory. In this paper we start with an effect algebraic approach to the study of non-locality and contextuality. We will see how different slices over the category of set valued functors on the natural numbers induce different settings in which non-locality and contextuality can be studied. This includes the Bell, Hardy and Kochen–Specker-type paradoxes. We link this to earlier sheaf theoretic approaches by defining a fully faithful embedding of the category of effect algebras in this presheaf category over the natural numbers.}

author = {Bart Jacobs},
abstract = {The shriek modality \s! of linear logic performs two tasks: it restores in annotated from both weakening and contraction. We separate these tasks by introducing two modalities: !w for weakening and !c for contraction. These give rise to two logics which are “inbetween” linear and intuitionistic logic: in affine (or weakening) logic one always has a weakening and a !w for contraction and in relevant (or contraction) logic one always has a contraction and a !w weakening. The semantics of these logics is obtained from special kinds of monads, introduced by Anders Kock in the early seventies. As subtle point is how to retrieve the \s! of linear logic from !w and !c. Technically this will be achieved in terms of distributive laws—introduced by Jon Beck. We find models where one has \s! = !w!c and also models with \s! = !c!w. It will be shown that on the category of complete lattices one has comonads !w and !c with !w!c = \s!= !c!w.}

abstract="This paper describes some basic relationships between mathematical structures that are relevant in quantum logic and probability, namely convex sets, effect algebras, and a new class of functors that we call `convex functors'; they include what are usually called probability distribution functors. These relationships take the form of three adjunctions. Two of these three are `dual' adjunctions for convex sets, one time with the Boolean truth values {\{}0,1{\}} as dualising object, and one time with the probablity values [0,1]. The third adjunction is between effect algebras and convex functors.",
